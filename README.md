# School Player
Yay! School is in!
Working with react-player library, I've made an player where the user can add their own lecture stream to a custom playlist.
Other user can view this playlist in real-time. You can either choose to view the latest 10 lectures or the whole database of lectures.

These videos is also sorted of when they were added.
